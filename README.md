# Project darkField (DISCONTINUED)
~~WIP, will add more information when it's done~~
Discontinued due to insufficient microlens quality, even after many attempts, resulting in insufficient resolution (objects were barely recognizable even at a very short virtual distance)
Follow-up project with hopefully better results: https://github.com/Philippus229/Blurred-Reality
